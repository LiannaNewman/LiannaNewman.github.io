As I go through the [Actualize](http://actualize.co) coding bootcamp I'll blog about my experiences and recall new information I learned through these blog posts.

I welcome any questions, comments, and feedback.

I created this blog using Jekyll. You can find out more info about Jekyll and basic usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/).


Note: This post was updated on September 10, 2016 to reflect the coding bootcamp name change: Anyone Can Learn To Code is now Actualize.
