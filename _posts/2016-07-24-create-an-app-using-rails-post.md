I recently learned how to create an app with rails through the terminal.  Creating an app in the terminal is a fairly easy process. I’d like to review the steps below.

Note: First make sure you have rails installed, if you do not you can do so by entering the following code into your terminal:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ gem install rails
{% endhighlight %}

Inside the terminal, navigate to the folder you’ll want to store the app in. Then enter:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ rails new example-app
{% endhighlight %}

Next head into your new app folder and open it in your text editor to get started.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ cd example-app
$ atom .
{% endhighlight %}

Note: I used the text editor Atom.

I’ll get into database usage and the rails server in the next post, but you this is how you get started with a new app.
